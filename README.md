:: This repository demonstrates the core concepts of data warehouse infrastructure, focusing on the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. 
:: A data warehouse is a centralized system designed to store, integrate, and analyze large volumes of data from multiple sources, supporting business intelligence and decision-making.
:: The ETL process is fundamental to data warehousing: 
::   - Extract: Data is collected from various source systems.
::   - Transform: Data is cleaned, formatted, and transformed to meet analytical requirements.
::   - Load: The processed data is loaded into the data warehouse for querying and analysis.
:: This repository provides practical examples and exercises to help users understand and implement ETL workflows, illustrating how data flows from raw sources into a structured warehouse environment.
